# Zoom

This is a brand-new programming language that's in its very earliest stages, so you probably won't be able to contribute yet. Watch this space, though.

## Aim

To create a modular, concise server-side language that's blazing fast. Developers will be able to create concurrent, parallel and even distributed systems, all with the same syntax. Zoom will be dynamically typed and allocated, but compiled to native machine code.

## How it works

Currently, the compiler is written in JavaScript (Node.js) but will eventually be ported to Zoom itself. Zoom source code is compiled to C++ temporarily, before using the system's compiler to generate machine code.

## To do

There's a lot to be done, and you can find what's planned [here](todo.md).
